			<p>This past fall I had an opportunity to start performing live music at local restaurant, The Family Dog, in downtown
			Orono.  I performed Saturdays from 11-2pm and I played popular radio music on guitar, ukulele, and with one
			song just my vocals using a loop pedal which was always fun to do and received positive reviews. </P>
			<p>During the winter I've taken a break due to slower business, but my hopes are once warmer weather rolls in (most likely
			not until August or something like that cause #Maine) that I'll start up doing Live Music again because that is a rather
			good source of income on the weekends.</p>
			<p> I also have for the past 3-4 years been a Worship leader a variety of Baptist Churches, namely my home church of Hodgdon United 
			Baptist Church, Crosspoint Church (formerly Bangor Baptist Church), and my fiance's church Head of the River Baptist Church
			in Cutler, Maine.  I lead using guitars, piano, bass, and vocals.  For worship songs we normally do not use the traditional hymns
			but instead do contemporary Christian music that are sometimes readapated Hymns with a new "popier" melody.  Artists such as
			Chris Tomlin and Hillsong Worship are common sources for worship songs in most churches with songs like "Cornerstone", "Oceans",
			"At the Cross", and "Our God".
