			At first I wanted to have nothing to do with Fraternity life because of the typical
			fraternity stereotypes of parties and hazing, but the guys down at SigEp were persistent
			and kept after me to consider joining.  After hanging out with some of them and getting
			to know what SigEp stood for and what they were about, it really opened my mind up to
			fraternity life and SigEp especially.  SigEp has a dry house, so no parties, and we pride
			ourselves in our high standards of academic success by requiring members to achieve and
			maintain at least a 3.0 GPA, with our chapter GPA averaging around a 3.4.
			<br></br>
			We also pride ourselves in a principle we call Sound Body which means that we strive to 
			take care of our body and live healthy lifestyles.  In intramurals, we have won the overall
			intramural award, the BC Kent, 8 of the last 9 years, with winning the last 4.  We also 
			strive to accumulate lots of community service hours and help out our local community.  Many
			of our members hold leadership positions on campus such as in Student Government, Senior
			Skulls, Sophomore Owls, and many more.  Our chapter and SigEp nationally have adopted the
			"Balanced Man" principle that stands that our members strive to be balanced in all areas of
			life, specifically in 4 areas: Athlete, Scholar, Gentleman, and Leader.
			<br></br>
			This principle also mandates that all chapters have a rolling recruitment process meaning
			that we may recruit potential new members at any point during the academic year, and not
			just during a "Rush Week."  Potential new members received a "bid" which has been approved
			democratically by the Chapter as a whole, and have up to one calendar year to accept
			membership, at which point they are a full member of SigEp and have all the rights and 
			privileges as any other member.</P>
