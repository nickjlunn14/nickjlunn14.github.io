		<h3>Chapter 1: Computer Engineering</h3>
			<p>My first major was Computer Engineering because I thought I was tech savvy, but I quickly realized
			that I was not truly computer savvy because most of these kids that I was in class with had
			built their own computers in middle school while I was playing sports and video games during
			that time.  I did enjoy the programming aspect of it the most as this assignment of making a
			webpage using HTML reminds me of the summer going into college and that first semester.</P>
		
		<h3>Chapter 2: Kinesiology & Physical Education</h3>
			<p>I quickly switched into KPE after my first semester because I've always enjoyed health and fitness
			and learning how the human body works.  I chose the Exercise Science option because I wanted
			to pursue my DPT (Doctor of Physical Therapy) after UMaine.  I truly enjoyed my time in the
			KPE program as all the classes were (mostly) fun and enjoyable and even some classes were 
			essentially a glorified gym class (KPE 253,426).  However, as I got to the close of my junior
			year and planning on applying to grad schools, I quickly realized how expensive it would be 
			to go for 3 years to schools like Husson or UNE without any aid and only receive a $60,000
			salary.  So here comes major change #3.  Well, adding a major.</p>
		
		<h3>Chapter 3:  Accounting</h3>
			<p>In Spring of 2016 I declared a second degree, Accounting, because I am handy with numbers and excel
			and I figured this major would fit my semi-introvertish nature.  I only had 12 credits left to
			towards my KPE degree so I figured I'd just finish that up slowly over the next couple years 
			as I worked towards my Accounting degree.  My hopes are to get my CPA license and then work my
			way up to a CFO by my early- to mid-30s.</p>
